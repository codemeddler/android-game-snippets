# android-game-snippets

Code snippets for Android 2.2 era games for reference use. Used with Android 2.2 era hardware in around 2013, so might
need a lot of rework to work with current Android versions. Hardware has also improved, so you wouldn't have to be as
limited with modern hardware as you were back then.

As the code is removed from projects and is old, the code is not usable as is. Code should however give reference on how
to do low-level game coding on Android.

JewelTilt is the original code for a game I self-published on Android market. It reached +1,000 downloads without any
promotion, which was a pretty good result.

TwinTilt was a rework of JewelTilt I started, but gave up on as I don't own any Android devices and haven't in years. I
have removed the music assets from the resource directories as I could not find the copyright for the audio anymore (the
musician has retired and taken down his website).

Dragon Squad was an extension on the "engine" of JewelTilt. It featured an isometric sprite tilemap and animated
sprites. Though in very early stages.
